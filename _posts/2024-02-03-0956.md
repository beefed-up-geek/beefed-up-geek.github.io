# How to download **google colab** as **markdown**
When you use a Jupyter notebook to analyze and submit or share an assignment, you need to download it as a markdown file or html file because you cannot just send it to the notebook.

While Anaconda Jupyter Notebook makes it easy to export as a .md file or .html file, it is unfortunate that cloab only supports downloading as an .ipynb file and a .py file.

Of course, there is also a way to commit to GitHub and convert it again in GitHub, but it is cumbersome, and I would like to convey how to convert the notebook file by simply running Code Cell in Colab Notebook.





First, I created a laptop test file in Google Drive as shown below.![asdfgfhggdhg](\images\2024-02-03-0956\asdfgfhggdhg.PNG)

## How to convert the colab notebook (.ipnyb) to markdown (.md)


1.   Download the notebook as .ipnyb and add it to the notebook file
2.   copy the path of the file and execute **`!jupyter nbconvert --to markdown "YOUR_PATH.ipnyb""`
3. The same directory will contain **"YOUR_PATH.md"**

2. Every other instructions are the same except execute **`!jupyter nbconvert --to markdown "YOUR_PATH.ipnyb""`
