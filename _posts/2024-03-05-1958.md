# Maximum (contiguous) subarray sum

Reference: SKKU  Introduction to Algorithm Lecture / instructor: HyoungShick Kim

Maximum subarray sum is a method to find the  maximum value of the contiguous indices in a array. Lets checkout the example.![afdhsghgfhj](\images\2024-03-05-1958\afdhsghgfhj.JPG)

In the given array, subarray composed of indices 1~4 makes the maximum sum of contiguous subarray. But how can we find which subarray makes the maximum value? There are three main ways to find the maximum subarray.

1. naive approach(brute force)
2. method using Dynamic Programming
3. the Maximum contiguous subarray sum algorithm

## Naive Approach (Brute force)

Naive approach to find the maximum would be to simply find all possible subarrays and compare their sums.

The number of possible subarrays would be 7C2 because finding all the possible starting indice and eding indice gives us all the possible subarrays. 

In conclusion the time complexity of Naive approach would be **O(n^2)**

## Recursive function

This method uses a recursive function that is programmed in a such way

> recursive_function (array):
>
> ​	max_left = recursive_function(left_subarray)
>
> ​	max_right = recursive_function(right_subarray)
>
> ​	max_middle =  find max subarray that crosses the middle point
>
> ​	return MAX(max_left, max_right, max_middle)

splitting the array into two until we can't, recursive function is called ***log*n** times.

Then how can we find the maximum subarray that crosses the middle point?

Finding the maximum subarray that crosses the middle point is done by such manner. Since the subarray essentially cross the middle point, find the right end and left end of the subarray that gives us the maximum value of the subarray with the maximum sum. 

Such manner costs **O(n)** time complexity.

In summery, since finding the maximum subarray crossing the middle point is done in every recursive function call, recursive method gives us time complexity of **O(n*log*n)**

## Maximum subarray sum algorithm

This algorithm uses Dynamic Programming method called "cut your losses(손절)"

starting from indice 0, we choose either to dump or keep adding the former sum of arrays. 

Lets look at the example.

![afgahghagh](\images\2024-03-05-1958\afgahghagh.JPG)

For this algorithm we need another array of same size named *mem*(abbreviation of memory). This array contains possible maximum sum values that ends at the given indice. Lets keep looking how it goes.

![afshgaghgh](\images\2024-03-05-1958\afshgaghgh.JPG)

So for the value for *mem[0]* would be -3 since there are no prior indices.

 ![fgahaghg](\images\2024-03-05-1958\fgahaghg.JPG)

The value for *mem[1]* would be 2 because since the value of *mem[0]* is a negative number adding up the former sums would be a loss to indice 1. So indice 1 decided to cut the loss and start all over from beginning.

 ![afghahsfgaf](\images\2024-03-05-1958\afghahsfgaf.JPG)

*mem[2]* would be 6 as mem[1] is a positive number adding up gives us a bigger value. 

If we keep this process until the end we get the result below.

![asfgafdgfghHG](\images\2024-03-05-1958\asfgafdgfghHG.JPG)

The meanings of these *mem* values are the possible maximum subarrays that ends in the given indices. So the maximum subarray sum would end at indice number 4. By finding the first negative mem value from the left indice of 4 which is indice number 0, we can infer that the max subarray starts from indice 1. 



In conclusion the time complexity of such algorithm would be **O(n)** since we simply started the simple "cut your losses" method from the beginning to the end.
