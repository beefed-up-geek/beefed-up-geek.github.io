# Algorithm, induction, time complexity, and RAM model

reference: MIT 6.006 Introduction to Algorithms

This lecture mainly deals with main concepts of algorithms, induction, time complexity and RAM model. 

Lets delve into what they are.

## Algorithm

What algorithm basically is a **plan** to solve a computational problem.  But it has to be more **abstract** than a actual code, yet **formal** in a sense of computational operation.
